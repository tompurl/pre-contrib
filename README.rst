Overview
========

``pre-contrib`` is just a bucket of files that could be part of the ``contrib``
directory for several projects. For example, the carbon_ project doesn't
include an init script that you can use on Debian-based systems, so I created
one and am sharing it here.

These are files that I should eventually submit as patches to their respective
projects. They are useful to me, so they are probably useful to someone else.

Each folder below has its own README file, so feel free to take a look and see
if I'm sharing anything that may be useful to you.
